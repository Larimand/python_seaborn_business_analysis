# Analysis of discount efficiency of a business using Python, Seaborn and Matplotlib
 
## 🎯 Project Overview
This project analyses our sample company's discount efficiency and determines whether they should disocunts as they are doing it right now.
We used Python to clean and analyse the provided data about products and prices and used seaborn to plot the results.
We came to the conclusion that we should definitely change our discount strategy.
